AUTHORS : List of developers with mail adress
COPYING : 
ChangeLog : the ChangeLog ^^
INSTALL : 
Makefile.am : automake Input File
NEWS :
README : this file
bootstrap : script to generate configure script from cvs repository checkout
config/ : to store some autotools generated files
configure.ac : autoconf Input File
doc : to store documentation about code only (cf doxygen, texinfo, etc.). Not to store a website discussing about it. Just use a separate CVS for the latter.
lib : to store libraries code is depending upon. None for the moment.
src : to store code...
test : to store self test suite code.

Other files not listed here are auto-generated files by Autotools for a distribution.
They are not in the CVS Repository.

==============
Build Process |
==============

For development purpose
------------------------
Just after a cvs update or checkout :

- Use the bootstrap script the first time or
- use "autoreconf" to build/rebuild configure and Makefile.inS if you change something in autotools chain

For common users
-----------------
Just after a release untar :

Just type :

./configure
make all

======================
Making a distribution |
======================

The above implies that we include autoconf/automake generated files in distribution (refer make dist for that)
BUT those files are not in the cvs, since no work is done on it, to have a quite clean repository.
